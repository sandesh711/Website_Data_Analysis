# Website Data Analysis
#### This Repository is a part of my work while taking Data Analytics and Data Science related courses on Coursera
#### I have analysed my website data, main motive is not the end result but to apply the topics learnt such as Python Programming, Webscraping using BeatifulSoup, SQL, R programmimg, Excel
# Tasks  
#### 1.Find out what are the users browsing more on my website. - ***completed***
#### 2.What are top 10 URLs getting more hits on my website. - ***completed***
#### 3.Which celebrity/ personality profile getting more visits? - ***completed***  
(Used Python Webscraping via BeautifulSoup library)  
#### 4.What are the top referrer channel to my site. - ***completed*** 
(direct, google search engine, other search engines, etc.. my own pages referred users excluded) 
This has been completed using Python Webscraping with library BeautifulSoup
#### 5. What is the trends of website visitors. - ***completed***
(No of visitors overtime)  
#### 6. Most popular TAG words visualised via WordCloud - ***completed***

# Data Collection
Whenever a user browses any of my website, data like below will be saved. Which is used in this analysis.  
(user browsed pages, referrer pages, date and time of user hit)  

# Data Analysis and Preparation Process  
Data is stored in MySQL database. I will be cleaning the table data using MySQL queries. After Cleaning I will analyse data, and if any transformation needed do that in MySQL temporary table. I will be pulling required data to Microsoft Excel or may be upload to cloud R for further Analysis. For graphs and visualisation will use R, Tableau and Excel. A little modification and transformation to data is also done in R. 
To apply the Python webscraping topics in Task 4, I have created a web page and got information from the webpage using BeautifulSoup library.ChatGPT is a teammate with whom I ask for help when I get stuck. 
  
# Result   
Results are shared as excel file, when data analysis and graph is generated in excel. Visualisation from Rstudio tool saved as jpgs. Python programs are shared as jupyter notebook.
