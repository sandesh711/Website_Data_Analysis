# Data Collection
Whenever a user browses any of my website data like below will be saved. Which is used in this analysis.  
(user browsed pages, referrer pages, date and time of user hit)  

# Analysis Process  
Data is stored in MySQL database. I will be cleaning the table data using MySQL queries. After Cleaning I will analyse data, and if any transformation needed do that in MySQL temporary table. I will be pulling required data to Microsoft Excel or may be upload to cloud R for further Analysis. For graphs and visualisation will use R, Tableau and Excel. A little modification and transformation to data is also done in R. ChatGPT is a teammate with whom I ask for help when I get stuck.  
  
# Final Result   
Final Result will be shared in PPT or any other convenient way.
